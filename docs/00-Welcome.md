> _This is a **60-minute** workshop that will give you a hands-on introduction to the core concepts and best practices for interacting with OpenAI models._

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:

 - Describe GPT model capabilities and implementation
 - Understand prompt engineering concepts and best practices
 - Apply prompt engineering techniques to your own generative AI solutions


## Lab Outline

The lab is organized into sections, taking you from "understanding" (core concepts) to "doing" (hands-on exercises). Prioritize completing the exercises within the allotted time. You can then any remaining session time for open-ended exploration to build your own intuition for prompt engineering.

1. [Setup](/setup). Activate your access to the custom workshop Playground.
1. [Explore AI Models](/ai-models). Understand AI models available in Azure OpenAI Service.
1. [Understanding LLM's](/llms). Understand & experiment with prompts, completions.
1. [Prompt Engineering](/labs/Basic-Prompting/). Learn prompt engineering techniques for OpenAI models. 
1. [Learnings and Resources](/summary). Recap what you learned & identify next steps.
1. [Things To Try Next](/next-steps). If you have time, explore the capabilities of Bing Chat.
