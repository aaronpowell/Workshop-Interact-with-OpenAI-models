# Welcome

:::info LEARNING OBJECTIVES
This is a **60-minute workshop** that teaches you how to work with the OpenAI model GPT-3.5 Turbo (gpt-3.5-turbo). By the end of this workshop you should be able to:
 - Understand the capabilities and implementation of GPT models
 - Understand what Prompt Engineering is and best practices for prompting
 - Customize your natural language generative AI models using prompt engineering techniques
:::

## Workshop Sections
1. [Setup](Setup). Create and deploy the Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure Portal
2. [Explore AI Models](Explore-AI-Models). Understand the natural language models available in Azure OpenAI Service.
3. [Understanding LLM's](Understanding-LLMs). Understand and experiment with prompts and completions.
4. [Prompt Engineering](Prompt-Engineering). Interact through prompt engineering with OpenAI models. 
9. [Learnings and Resources](Learnings-and-Resources). Recap and links for further learning.
10. [Extra Credit](Extra-Credit). If you have time, explore the capabilities of Bing Chat.

## Instructor-Led Learning

This workshop may be run as an **instructor-led session** at some events.

In this case, the instructor will provide you with an **event key** that you will use during the [Setup](./05-Setup.md) phase, to gain access to an Azure OpenAI custom playground application _without requiring you to have an Azure subscription of your own_. The event key will be valid only for that session, and will require you to complete the workshop within the timeframe for that event.


## Self-Guided Learning

This workshop is also suitable for **self-guided learning** at home.

In this case, _you will need to bring your own Azure Subscription (with Azure OpenAI access enabled) or have an active OpenAI subscription_, to work on the exercises. You can then use one of the following playground options to try the exercises out at your own pace and schedule.
 - [Azure OpenAI Studio](https://oai.azure.com/portal) - requires an Azure subscription with Azure OpenAI access enabled.
 - [OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground) - requires a paid OpenAI account for usage.
