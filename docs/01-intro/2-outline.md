> _This is a **60-minute** workshop that will give you a hands-on introduction to the core concepts and best practices for interacting with OpenAI models._

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:

 - Describe GPT model capabilities and implementation
 - Understand prompt engineering concepts and best practices
 - Apply prompt engineering techniques to your own generative AI solutions


## Lab Outline

The workshop is organized as a series of hands-on lab exercises that take you systematically from core concepts to advanced techniques and best practices. 
Complete the workshop steps in order, to ensure you finish exercises within the allotted time. Then use any remaining time for open-ended exploration, and build your own intuition for prompt engineering in practice. 

The lab is organized as follows:

1. [Setup](/setup). Activate your access to the custom workshop Playground.
1. [Explore AI Models](Explore-AI-Models). Understand the natural language models available in Azure OpenAI Service.
1. [Understanding LLM's](Understanding-LLMs). Understand and experiment with prompts and completions.
1. [Prompt Engineering](Prompt-Engineering). Interact through prompt engineering with OpenAI models. 
1. [Learnings and Resources](Learnings-and-Resources). Recap and links for further learning.
1. [Extra Credit](Extra-Credit). If you have time, explore the capabilities of Bing Chat.
